GovTech provides ten tips for [getting the most from your data visualizations](http://www.govtech.com/pcio/10-Tips-for-Data-Visualization.html "GovTech's ten tips for getting the most from your data visualizations").

The tips include:

  * Use layers to tell a story
  * Involve users in the design
  * Be aware of multiple platforms
  * Use style to tell a story

Watch the on-demand event with presenter **Stephen Few**. Stephen is a principal with Perceptual Edge and presents simple skills and common mistakes you should avoid when &#8220;telling stories&#8221; using data visualization.
